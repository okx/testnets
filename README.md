# OKExChain Testnet

This repo collects the genesis, snapshot data and configuration files for the various ExChain
testnets. It exists so the [ExChain repo](https://github.com/okex/exchain)
does not get bogged down with large genesis files and status updates.

## Download the latest testnet data snapshot

 Download URL: 
 
- Download and uncompress the [snapshot](https://ok-public-hk.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/cdn/okexchain/snapshot/data_180.tar.gz) to exchaind directory
```
mv ~/.okexchaind ~/.exchaind
mv ~/.okexchaincli ~/.exchaincli
mv ~/.exchaind/config/okexchaind.toml ~/.exchaind/config/exchaind.toml
mv ~/.exchaind/data ~/.exchaind/data-bak
cd ~/.exchaind
wget -c https://ok-public-hk.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/cdn/okexchain/snapshot/data_180.tar.gz
tar -zxvf data_180.tar.gz
```
you can download other version from [this](https://okexchain-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources/snapshot.html)

- Check the snapshot by `ls -l ~/.exchaind/data`
```

## Start with the snapshot
2 ways to startup an exchain full node: 
- start with a docker image
- start with the exchaind binary

### 1. Start testnet with a docker image
- download the docker image
```
docker pull okexchain/fullnode-testnet:latest
```

- run docker based the snapshot downloaded in the previous step `Start based on snapshot`.
```
docker run -d --name exchain-testnet-fullnode -v ~/.exchaind/data:/root/.exchaind/data/ -p 8545:8545 -p 26656:26656 okexchain/fullnode-testnet:latest
```

- view the running log
```
docker logs --tail 100 -f exchain-testnet-fullnode
```

> You can stop the docker container with command: `docker rm -f exchain-testnet-fullnode`
When the docker container gets to the latest block, local RPC can be usedï¼š`http://localhost:8545`

### 2. Start testnet with the exchaind binary

- Build exchaind by [the latest released version v0.19.0](https://github.com/okex/exchain/releases/tag/v0.19.0)
```
make testnet
```

- Initialize exchain node configurations (skip this step if you did it before)
```shell script
exchaind init your_custom_moniker --chain-id exchain-65 --home ~/.exchaind
````

- Start exchaind
```shell script
export EXCHAIN_SEEDS="b7c6bdfe0c3a6c1c68d6d6849f1b60f566e189dd@3.13.150.20:36656,d7eec05e6449945c8e0fd080d58977d671eae588@35.176.111.229:36656,223b5b41d1dba9057401def49b456630e1ab2599@18.162.106.25:36656"
exchaind start --chain-id exchain-65 --home ~/.exchaind --p2p.seeds $EXCHAIN_SEEDS
```
